# 
LEARNT 

- I used https://stackedit.io/app# to see how my markdown file looks completely although I can see italics/bold within Visual Studio Code
- How to clone / change to my desired directory 
- You can use # for heading level 1, ## for heading level 2 and so on until level 6
- I can add images externally or from my desktop and can change the size of my image by adding =200x200 inside the () brackets 
- **using two stars makes bold text** 
- using *one star makes italic text* 
- You can have ordered and unordered lists

> you can also add block quotes with a forward facing arrow 


QUESTIONS 
- How do I delete my files/secondary profile on GIT as I was initially on the Jackson cohort 
- If my specific 'homework-Girl28511' appears twice on the Thomas board, will you be looking at the latest?
